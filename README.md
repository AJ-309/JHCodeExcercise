### Introduction to Cypress
Cypress framework is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework built on Mocha â€“ a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and convenient. Cypress and Javascript is used for this project.

### Test Design Approach
Since these are E2E tests, all tests starts from amazon homepage and not considering only particular functionality on specific page. Because of time limit, this project includes all 3 tests for guest user. Page object model is used to construct all these tests.
